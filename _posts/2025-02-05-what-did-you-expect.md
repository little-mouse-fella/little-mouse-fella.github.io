# What did you expect?<br>

Cramped dim halls + stretched-out walls<br>
and closed-up shower curtains;<br>
lights that strobe 'til I look<br>
transmit Lynchian violence.<br>
—simply want existence,<br>
and perchance benevolence.<br>

The nice bowl's a puke bowl<br>
since I bought one that's better.<br>

Let’s take a seat, let’s rest our feet<br>
on stools with colored cushions;<br>

let’s greet and chat until I know<br>
exactly what you’re saying.<br>
The year's unknown until it's passed<br>
through layers of our talking. <br>
<br>
There’s grounding in horror<br>
and there’s pain in letting go—<br>

peering deeply into<br>
midnight on your moonless night.<br>

—want to be forgotten<br>
and so strain for dim next days<br>
—take after—the cotton<br>
and as-blind-ly-float-a-way.<br>

From first principles I'm<br>
learning heroics from those<br>

untold cells that birthed me--<br>
living for my own loves.<br>

The self's made of touchstones,<br>
daily-scheduled neural knots--<br>
here's hoping, come my time<br>
it all ends on a good thought.<br>
