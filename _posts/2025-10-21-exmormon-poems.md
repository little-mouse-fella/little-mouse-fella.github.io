# But then face to face
What should you call it when
you no longer pine-sigh after life-after-life
and death's Great Audit, once urgent, is warmly arms-length
What do you call--when you compose
moral chords to the cadence of your conscience
not once hushing her
and the divine Presence is crescendo fermata
no longer intermittent staccato
and you have no vow to change
those you love,
   only vows *to* them, forever
Unsure what to call life after church, but it's
how I'd pictured Heaven
# Shadows lengthen on my faith
Inedible, undrinkable, unwatchable, unthinkable;
humanityâ€™s a-writhing;
I want my life 
to come together, 
just like in the Bible.

# This is how I left God
to bed!
a worried child will wipe the floor in negotiation and
some nights my son\'s one, persistent-politely pleading for a
snack
back-ride
book
back-ride
--little freshman of life whose loneliness rises
with the sunset, so he blazes westward.
My departure's all clingy-confused false starts 'til
my sweaty heart quiets his cries behind a maligned door
shameful, disobedient child that I am.
Other nights, though, we
equally eagerly anticipate each next page of the
bear, fish, and bird books, and
chat, wrestle and--already
waterproof sheets sigh, embrace his return
thumb finding his mouth, inbuilt infant bliss.
He asks me to pray for monster trucks thrice and
"bye-bye," his fingers wave, and with melty heart I
wilfully mop myself out the door.

This is how I left God--
   not in the living room counting nighttime hours, like a teen's
   beleaguered parent
   not calling my lost name over the grocery store speakers
not like my son on insatiable days,
but after the story and the wrestle,
leading Him, at His bidding,
to bed.
