Wrote this a couple years ago.
## I’m Ready
How do I know that I’m ready to write about it? Because I need to write about it. Writing about it is now what I have to do, to get to the next stage.

Religion is beautiful and terrible as the dawn. I looked up that quote so I could insert it here, and the full quote, from the book, is even more apt:
> And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!

It’s like a garden wherein grow all kinds of things–beautiful roses and venomous thorns. Be careful in there!

I used to think of doctrine as a web of connected truths. The Atonement goes here, in the center. Priesthood authority goes there, and the timeline of dispensations go here and here. The plan of salvation is the biggest part of the diagram, containing many other parts. Everything fits. Everything represents the truth as God knows it, and as we're able to receive it. It hums like an engine.

The engine breaks down, though, and it's always inconvenient when it does. It's disconcerting, is what it is. But usually it just needs some maintenance.

You learn about polygamy, say, and your whole conception of a loving God, and marriage of fidelity, grinds and squeals fitfully. The machine limps into the shop, and the mechanic, wiping his hands, returns: you were running low on faith. God isn't going to explain everything: some things require faith. It's like refilling the brake fluid. Thank goodness. You're back on your way.

Or, sometimes, an actual component is needed. Some tactile idea to fit into the machine. What's needed, with polygamy, is some concept that unites a loving God and an incomprehensible commandment. To find it, we can speculate some pretty convincing reasons for polygamy. When you think about it, maybe God needed to “raise up seed” for the church to be big enough later on. Maybe this speculation, or an even better one, strengthens the machine enough and we can trot out of the shop.

But that “polygamy” part of the engine is going to keep giving trouble. It’ll bring you back into the shop again and again. And maybe that’s okay. Maybe that’s what faith looks like: always searching. Always repairing.

Always figuring _why_ this bizarre, incongruous, occasionally sublime thing is true.

I don't have to acknowledge that contradiction. Which, I argue, is a way for our minds to kind of wrap that belief (in inerrancy, or univocality, or whatever) in this little security blanket, so it does not have to confront the reality of a belief that is not in agreement with the data out there in the world.

I’m worried about paying tithing. I actually haven’t paid it in a while, so it will be another lump sum when I pay again (probably a…month’s? worth). I know part of my dislike is that it’s sad to see money go away. But there’s more to it now. I’m not sure about the institution it’s funding. It’s strange to say that, since this is God’s church. And yet, questions arise. I don’t like hearing about how the Church responds to child abuse cases within its congregations. I don’t like how women are treated in the Church. I don’t like how authentically queer folk are outright excluded from what will exalt them. The scriptural and revelatory explanation for this, furthermore, is weak, and little effort is given to either abandon it or bolster it. The teaching just languishes there, a dying guardian of the temple. It’s a big billboard sign that says: “We’re not sure about this doctrine, so we don’t explain it deeply”--and, on the other side, “Tradition”.

I used to approach “faithful searching” like I said above: finding out _why_ something incongruous is actually good. Now I think “faithful searching” is just _finding_ _what's true_.

It’s seen as a virtue to spiritually visit the mechanic regularly, devotedly keeping the doctrinal machine running. Weird machine pieces like polygamy are mysteriously part of God’s plan. The trouble is that the more I learn about God, the more I realize that conspiratorial mysteries aren't really his thing. He’s too much in the light.

In fact, the whole idea of the machine is wrong. Truth is distills like the dews of heaven onto an individual’s soul. It can’t be bound up and locked into shape like a puzzle or a fandom wiki or a car engine. It’s not how it works, and I think that’s why it’s so clunky and awkward to run my gospel faith like that.

More than awkward. In my heart of hearts is a primal terror when the gospel engine light comes on. Because if it’s not true, there’s no meaning, no joy. If it's not true, there are nothing but guesses to go on, and no promise of peace.

I used to think that faith was about holding firm despite a few unanswerable questions. Now I believe faith is curiously investigating many solvable questions, with no goal but truth and wellbeing.

–

When I look back, faith was too much like filling plot holes in my favorite fandom to make the timelines make sense. Maybe like loyally finding reasons to like the B-rated films in the franchise. Now I think it’s just about appreciating the good stories without atoning for their occasional lack of continuity. It’s like a weight removed from my shoulders, and permission to rest from defending depressing contradictions, and just enjoy the good.

“Is it okay not to pay tithing?” I pray. The answer I might be feeling is a certain resignation from God. Like he doesn’t like to say it, but sometimes the institution needs to suffer withdrawal of member support, so it will learn. Like he wants the Church to succeed, but if I tithe elsewhere for a pricked conscience, he can’t blame me. Even after hearing this, I feel torn. Did I hear him right?

My tithe has dwindled from 10% of gross to 10% of net. That was cut in half when my wife decided she was done tithing to the Church, and tithe to other charities and to friends in need. It has been very fulfilling for me to see her money go to them. 

But I've felt guilty that I get to have it both ways: keep a temple recommend with my half, and see Hannah's half go to good use. Better use? I feel like I know the answer, but I stay my hand so I can feel happy in the temple of our God.

I love the temple. It’s one of the things I feel is truly inspired in the Church. 

I go, and everyone glows.

We’re united in our weird clothes.

We’re united in the grief that brought us seeking solace here.

The temple video teaches me God welcomes us into His presence.

Of course, there are a lot of things wrong with the endowment, too. Mostly it's the feminist in me saying that. Vast, revelatory improvements have been made there, and in the other troubling aspects of the temple covenants. There are still miles to go before we sleep, though.

And sometimes I wonder how much of my temple enjoyment is in its exclusivity. But no, I think I would still enjoy it if its doors were open to one and all. There’s a small, petulant part of me that wants it to be a closed club; should the doors be opened, it would reduce the specialness of the place. But a better part of me would awaken and rejoice to see everyone welcomed into His presence. All who want to be there…can be there. What’s wrong with that?

What else do I like about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? I like giving priesthood blessings. Someone asks for help, and I lay my hands on their head and try to channel the divine for them. And I feel the divine presence. I feel like myself, too, and I know I wind up saying many things that are just from me. But I hear and understand some things from God during that process, and I ask the receiver to discern for themselves what is good and what’s not, in there. 

The justification for male exclusivity is traditional: that men and women have different roles. Men hold the priesthood; women are motherhood. But then I laugh as I ask: how on earth is priesthood-bearing so distracting that it would encroach on motherhood? Setting aside the leadership callings–how bad would it be for a mother just to be able to priesthood bless her child? Not so bad, thought Brother Joseph, who allowed women to give the laying on of hands in Jesus’ name. Another mystery in a machine I feel heaven-blessed to retire.

Today as I pulled into the rec center parking lot, and I thought about how much I like giving blessings, I just felt released. Because I realized my tithe needn't go to the Church, for me to be able to give a good blessing.
