I wrote most of these over a year ago.
## But then face to face
What should you call it when<br>
you no longer pine-sigh after life-after-life<br>
and death's Great Audit, once urgent, is warmly arms-length<br>
What do you call--when you compose<br>
moral chords to the cadence of your conscience<br>
not once hushing her<br>
and the divine Presence is crescendo fermata<br>
no longer intermittent staccato<br>
and you have no vow to change<br>
those you love,<br>
   only vows *to* them, forever<br>
Unsure what to call life after faith, but it's<br>
how I'd pictured Heaven
## Shadows lengthen on my faith
Inedible, undrinkable, unwatchable, unthinkable;<br>
humanityâ€™s a-writhing;<br>
I want my life <br>
to come together, <br>
just like in the Bible.<br>

## This is how I left God
To bed!<br>
A worried child will wipe the floor in negotiation and
some nights my son\'s one, persistent-politely pleading for a<br>
snack<br>
back-ride<br>
book<br>
back-ride<br>
--little freshman of life whose loneliness rises<br>
with the sunset, so he blazes westward.<br>
My departure's all clingy-confused false starts 'til<br>
my sweaty heart quiets his cries behind a maligned door<br>
shameful, disobedient child that I am.<br>
Other nights, though, we<br>
equally eagerly anticipate each next page of the<br>
bear, fish, and bird books, and<br>
chat, wrestle and--already<br>
waterproof sheets sigh, embrace his return<br>
thumb finding his mouth, inbuilt infant bliss.<br>
He asks me to pray for monster trucks thrice and<br>
"bye-bye," his fingers wave, and with melty heart I<br>
wilfully mop myself out the door.<br>

This is how I left God--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; not in the living room counting nighttime hours,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; not calling my lost name over the grocery store speakers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; not like my son on insatiable days,<br>
but after the story and the wrestle,<br>
leading Him, at His bidding,<br>
to bed.
