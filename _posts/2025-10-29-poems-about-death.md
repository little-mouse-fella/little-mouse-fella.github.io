## Nature
Forgive me for my elder years
I'll probably be awful.
Complain and suffer and make you feel like shit.
Forgive me for my ailing brain; I used to love you better.
Some things just happen that way; some people die mean.

I’m guessing that, before our phones (these new ones with the latest, worst version of the internet on them), we used to be more connected to the places we lived. The hard distinction between person and neighbor, and the ways you manage to get along together, were not always encourage, but they were defined. Now it seems like we have no way of relating to each other, even by way of quarreling. There used to be a kind of neighborly fight that dragged on, but in a good way—people reasoned and begged out their efforts to relate to the people around them in some way. At least, I think we did. Now, anyways, our experience of the world is heavily colored by our personally most revenue-generating algorithm, and we get this idea of the world that’s unrelated to the community we live in. What scares me most is that many people don’t seem to understand how susceptible they are to propaganda. 

I said, “I love this beer,” and 
she goes, “Yes, you bring it to your 
lips and it kisses you back, slowly.”

## How to make peace with the religion of your upbringing
Don’t try to. Pay attention to the pangs and unsanded edges of it. Be bewildered when “I’m praying for you in the temple” begins to sound like a  “❤️” reaction compared to love. Follow the urge to change her contact from “Mom” to “\<first>\<last>”. 
Weather this without shame, and you’ll begin to see her endearing quirks and feel kinship in your parenthood

## Happiness is something that occurs to you
Everything occurs to me;
No thought is my own.
Unless you count me as the brain
that jotted this note down.


I want to finish my life on a good thought

The self's a collection of touchstones

I took a long walk, then put the cat to sleep on the cat tree.
She fell asleep with me scratching her neck. she didn’t lift her head when I 
got up to start writing
this. she was motionless—like you are sometimes, occasionally, when 
you too fall alseep in my arms. I’m so flattered that you 
can fall asleep in my arms.

as I’d been walking into the house from my walk, I was overcome with a feeling like being
home. and it was strange because, when have I ever felt alone in my own home? and the answer, I 
realized, was, always.


I want to be forgotten
I strain for dim next days
I‘ll take after the cotton, and
blindly float away


you deranged automaton


So I go on these walks in the evening,
and I bring my vape with me,
and get high as I go. It’s so relaxing, and I
get to think about how I’ve been doing the past few weeks, 
and which mental states preceded which.

Sometimes I find
a perfectly friendly place to sit down, and I’ll just 
think about my fallout with my mom.
Intentions are just imagined memories of plans, now. 
Pain's a persistent interruption, a stuckness.

I’ve become a pet person over time, and honestly
I’ve begun to associate animal people with good character.
To be generous in assigning sentience and experience
to the creatures around you, that’s good, I think.

My cat's furtive glances, with-
drawal, her misinterpreting of signals, the odd 
moment of deep connection, the oddness of connection—

she's essentially romantic in nature, not 
lovey-dovey--she
lives out that banal essence of romance.
