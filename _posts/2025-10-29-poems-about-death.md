## My ailing brain used to love you better
Forgive me for my elder years;<br>
I'll probably give you dread;<br>
I'll bark at you and <br>
suffer, and make you feel like shit.<br>

Some things happen that way; <br>
some homeland deports you, <br>
some best friend dies mean.

I’m guessing that, before we had phones with the worst version of the internet, we were more connected to the places we lived. The hard distinction between person and neighbor, and the ways you manage to get along together, were not always happy, but they were defined and in stasis. 

Our phones put us in little worlds that seem to share so little in common with each other. On my walk I watch my little version of the United States in front of me, scrollable, every post sycophantically affirming my worldview; and when I pass someone on their phone, i must guess their algorithm overlaps with mine but also differs significantly.

Now it seems like we have no way of relating to each other, even by way of quarreling. There used to be a kind of neighborly fight that dragged on, but in a good way—people reasoned and begged out their efforts to relate to the people around them in some way. Now, anyways, we walk around . What scares me most is that many people don’t seem to understand how susceptible they are to propaganda. 

“I love this beer.”<br>
“Yes, you bring it to your lips and it kisses you back slowly.”

## How to make peace with the religion of your upbringing
Don’t try to. Pay attention to the pangs and unsanded edges of it. Be bewildered when “I’m praying for you in the temple” begins to sound like a  “❤️” reaction. Follow the urge to change her contact from “Mom” to “\<first>\<last>”. 

## Happiness happens to you
Everything occurs to me;<br>
No thought is my own.<br>
Unless you count me as the brain<br>
that jotted this note down.


I want to finish my life on a good thought


The self's a collection of touchstones


I took a long walk, then put the cat to sleep on the cat tree.<br>
She fell asleep with me scratching her neck. she didn’t lift her head when I <br>
got up to start writing<br>
this. she was motionless—like you are sometimes, occasionally, when <br>
you too fall alseep in my arms. I’m so flattered that you <br>
can fall asleep in my arms.<br>

as I’d been walking into the house from my walk, I was overcome with a feeling like being<br>
home. and it was strange because, when have I ever felt alone in my own home? and the answer, I <br>
realized, was, always.


I want to be forgotten<br>
I strain for dim next days<br>
I‘ll take after the cotton, and<br>
blindly float away<br>


you deranged automaton


So I go on these walks in the evening,<br>
and I bring my vape with me,<br>
and get high as I go. It’s so relaxing, and I<br>
get to think about how I’ve been doing the past few weeks, <br>
and which mental states preceded which.<br>

Sometimes I find<br>
a perfectly friendly place to sit down, and I’ll just <br>
think about my fallout with my mom.<br>
Intentions are just imagined memories of plans, now. <br>
Pain's a persistent interruption, a stuckness.<br>

I’ve become a pet person over time, and honestly<br>
I’ve begun to associate animal people with good character.
To be generous in assigning sentience and experience
to the creatures around you, that’s good, I think.

My cat's furtive glances, with-
drawal, her misinterpreting of signals, the odd 
moment of deep connection, the oddness of connection—

she's essentially romantic in nature, not 
lovey-dovey--she
lives out that banal essence of romance.
