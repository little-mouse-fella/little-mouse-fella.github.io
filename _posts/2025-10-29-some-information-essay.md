The mind searches forward: backward: across, says a shallowly-held thought, dislikes the next mental state, and stops for a second

to scrub the prefrontal cortex of the thought so's not to repeat and reinforce it longer.

Anxiety increases when the prefrontal cortex finishes rebooting, retroactively imagines (models) the instinctive actions that took place during the blackout, and overthinks their implications.

The universe is deterministic. I am what my brain's information feels like. My brain is more plastic when I can hold the belief that even my recent actions were fated. My awareness has no effect on the world. Free will is an illusion, but consciousness is not.

Even my recent actions were fated. Even my current actions are fated. 

What medium of information is the brain? It's models that can be represented symbolically.

Is the intent of the artist everything, in art? Where does art go from symbolic causality to just causality? What I'm getting at is that one aspect of art is outright symbolism, where the artist's intent means everything. But another aspect of art is the subjective experience of it--that is, rightly valuing it for its unintended effects.

What this helps explain is that the difference between information (that is, ) and causality is that information can be measured by how well the effects represent the cause. Information theory could be helpful here. 


Someday I’ll look back on the delicious *feel* of my nighttime walks. But tonight people like ghosts follow me and cross my path. I feel out of step and ill-at-ease right now. Life isn’t experienced as a passive movie for *anyone*. 

Goals: worlds best learner
Die slowly where you get all the dmt. I would hate to die abruptly, not having time to mentally model out what’s happening until it’s too late, not knowing I have just—



Whoaaaaaa I think the concept of the present is a lie

The meaning of a symbol is what it can do. 

Whether those effects are intended (modeled) by the sending node is inessential to its constituting information. See dna passed from one cell to another and executing its code. 

Knowledge is a set of generally similar pieces of information


#scripture 
Make a book that’s just a bunch of excerpts from my journals. Formatted as scripture
Cuz I could only think in terms of platitudes. Measure my ideas in terms of how scriptural and spiritual and insightful they felt.
