#todo: turn this into a side-by-side translation between a mental narrative and a neural narrative
## CHAPTER 1: The meaning of a symbol is what it can do

1 Someday I’ll look back on the delicious *feel* of my nighttime walks. But tonight people like ghosts follow me and cross my path. I feel out of step and ill-at-ease right now. Life isn’t experienced as a passive movie for *anyone*. 

2 The mind searches forward: backward: across, says a shallowly-held thought, dislikes the next mental state, and stops for a second--

3 To scrub the prefrontal cortex of the information so's not to repeat and reinforce it longer.

4 Anxiety (compensatory speed) increases when the prefrontal cortex finishes rebooting, retroactively imagines the instinctive actions that took place during the blackout, and overthinks their implications.

5 The universe is deterministic. I am what my brain's information feels like. My brain is more plastic when I can hold the belief that even my recent actions were fated. My awareness has no effect on the world. Free will is an illusion, but experience is not.

6 Even my recent actions were fated. Even my current actions are fated.

7 Is the intent of the artist everything, in art? Where does art go from intended causality to just causality? What I'm getting at is that one aspect of art is outright symbolism, where the artist's intent means everything. But another aspect of art is the subjective experience of it--that is, rightly valuing it for its unintended effects. The meaning of a symbol is what it can do.
