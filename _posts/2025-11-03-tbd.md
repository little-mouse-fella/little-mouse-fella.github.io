## Reincarnate
You know, you never really talk to yourself about how every moment in your life has felt like its own lifetime. As a teenager, I imagined myself existing some decade in the future, 
in some different situation. But that "me" never made it to 29. He's gone. 
He's just gone. It's just me now. I inherited his memories. 

Sometimes I admire or envy him from afar, via these old letters and journal entries. Other times I find myself embarrassed to be associated.

I'm just an absolutely different person than I was two decades ago. My mental makeup is related to today's, but it's not the same at all. The intervening experiences did this to me, so they are as much a part of me as my own body.
