title: Eclectic poem
---
## You deranged automaton
Crisping dunes of pastry leaves,<br>
smoking on a walk,<br>
like baklava after summer's work,<br>
potluck after three-hour block.<br>

I need to realize some next thing, but<br>

everything occurs to me;<br>
no thought is my own;<br>
unless you count me as the brain<br>
that jots a poem down.<br>

I want to be forgotten--<br>
I strain for dim next days--<br>
I‘ll take after the cotton, and<br>
blindly float away.<br>

So I go on these walks in the evening,<br>
and bring my relaxing vice<br>
and mentally meander the past few weeks, <br>
see which mind-states preceded which.<br>

Sometimes I find<br>
a perfectly friendly place to sit down, and I’ll just <br>
think about my fallout with my mom.<br>
Intentions are just imagined memories of plans, now. <br>
Pain's a persistent interruption, a stuckness.<br>

Cutting through thick-laced memory foam,<br>
figures appear like trees, and<br>
a stark thing like blame emerges;<br>
he's comfortable, at home.<br>

But I've comfort in that we've a difference--<br>

I’ve become a pet person, and now<br>
ascribe animal people good character.<br>
When you’re generous in assigning experience<br>
to the creatures around you, you’re probably partial to protecting.<br>

My cat's furtive glances, with-<br>
drawal, her misinterpreting of signals, the odd <br>
moment of deep connection, the oddness of connection—<br>
she lives out that banal essence of romance.<br>

The self is many touchstones,<br>
repeated neural knots.<br>
I really hope when it’s my time<br>
I end on a good thought.<br>
