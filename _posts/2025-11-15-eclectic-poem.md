title: Eclectic poem
---
## You deranged automaton
Crisping dunes of pastry leaves,
smoking on a walk,
like baklava after summer's work,
potluck after three-hour block.

I need to realize some next thing, but

everything occurs to me;
no thought is my own;
unless you count me as the brain
that jots a poem down.

I want to be forgotten--
I strain for dim next days--
I‘ll take after the cotton, and
blindly float away.

So I go on these walks in the evening,
and bring my relaxing vice
and mentally meander the past few weeks, 
see which mind-states preceded which.

Sometimes I find
a perfectly friendly place to sit down, and I’ll just 
think about my fallout with my mom.
Intentions are just imagined memories of plans, now. 
Pain's a persistent interruption, a stuckness.

Cutting through thick-laced memory foam,
figures appear like trees, and
a stark thing like blame emerges;
he's comfortable, at home.

But I've comfort in that we've a difference--

I’ve become a pet person, and now
ascribe animal people good character.
When you’re generous in assigning experience
to the creatures around you, you’re probably partial to protecting.

My cat's furtive glances, with-
drawal, her misinterpreting of signals, the odd 
moment of deep connection, the oddness of connection—
she lives out that banal essence of romance.

The self is many touchstones,
repeated neural knots.
I really hope when it’s my time
I end on a good thought.
